\subsection{DINOv2 ViT}
We extracted 384 features for each of the 2061 images [camera type here], inserted them into a design matrix with rows containing a numerical feature and columns containing the image they originated from. The resulting 2961 x 384 matrix was then standardized and reduced with either PCA with 70 principal components, or UMAP with 2 embeddings. 

We present the first two components of the PCA plotted against each other in Figure \ref{fig:pca0pca1}, and the embeddings from UMAP in Figure \ref{fig:umap}. Both figures have labeled species data points, but this labels have not been provided for the DINO ViT model and are provided afterwards to see whether the feature representations we've retrieved can be considered good representations.

After analyzing the cumulative variance for each component (Appendix, Figure \ref{fig:cumsumpca}), we saw that including 70 components accounted for just above 85\% of the variance in the design matrix, and the first two components only account for around 26\%. This means that we cannot assume the PC representations to relay significant relationships in our data. 

In Figure \ref{fig:umap} we see clear clusters. We already know that the input images belonged to 14 categories, and yet we count 11 distinct cluster which is also confirmed by the silhouette score for each of the 2-20 KMeans clusters we tested (Appendix, Figure \ref{fig:kmean_sil}). We suspect that the species that have similar feature embeddings might also have some morphological similarities, which is confirmed by looking into some example photos in Figure \ref{fig:pseudo+empty}.
